Dear Sir/Madam,

How close are you to the idea of precise, flawless bread production, where every process runs automatically, and quality remains consistent?

With this vision in mind, we have been manufacturing bakery equipment for over 30 years, including sourdough machines, fermenters, leavening tanks, and starter cultures.

We meticulously combine robust construction and hygienic designs that meet ATEX and FDA standards. Through automation, we eliminate the risk of human error, lighten staff workloads, and shorten production times. The unparalleled consistency of fermentation processes allows you to achieve stable product quality and higher profitability.

We offer technologies tailored to small and medium-sized businesses, as well as advanced systems for industrial bakeries. Our solutions enable "clean label" production, which is increasingly valued by consumers.

Would you like to see how our machines work in practice? We would be happy to arrange a meeting and provide further details.


Best regards
Bruno Volf
