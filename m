RE:URGENT CHANGE OF ACCOUNT    

 I am Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the Newly appointed Director, IMF 
Legal Affairs, Security and Investigation, NY USA. The United 
States president and US Foreign Secretary (Athony Blinken), has 
directed me to Investigate your Fund and to make sure that we 
approve all outstanding debts owed to indigenous /Foreign 
beneficiaries by the government of the United States in this Last 
quarter of this Fiscal year 2021.

This decision was taken based on the abnormalities and inability 
of the BANKS in the United States to Release your fund into your 
bank account whereby it was discovered that some Directors in 
different organizations are diverting pending beneficiary's 
payment to another account of their choice. In view of this, 
during our investigation I found out that an account was 
submitted to divert your fund to a CYPRUS account. Below is the 
account submitted and I want you to confirm if you are aware of 
the new development because we are about effecting payment to the 
account stated below today.

NAME OF BENEFICIARY: GEORGE NIKOLAOU
BANK NAME: NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE ( CYPRUS)
ADDRESS: 86 MAKARIOS AVENUE BRANCH 541.,3506 LIMASSOL,CYPRUS
SWIFT CODE: ETHNCY2N541
IBAN NUMBER: CY81006005410000005413367487

Furthermore, be informed that a payment instruction has been 
issued and Forwarded to the Treasury Department of the US 
Government In favor of you and your company for immediate release 
of your fund to the account above without any further prejudice. 
But there is no way We can approve the fund to your account 
without you confirming if you have changed your account for your 
fund to be transferred to the Beneficiary: GEORGE NIKOLAOU BANK 
ACCOUNT IN CYPRUS.

Finally, Contact me immediately for further clarification to know 
if you have given such an instruction to transfer your fund to 
the above account today. On behalf Of the entire management of 
IMF, we are congratulating you in advance and if you fail to 
contact this office on or before 24hrs from now then we will 
proceed to wire the fund to the CYPRUS account.

Thanks for your cooperation.
Waiting for your urgent response

Sir Jeremy Greenstock
Consultant, Legal Affairs Security and Investigation.
IMF
